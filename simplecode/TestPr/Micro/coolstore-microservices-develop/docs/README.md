# Introduction

## CoolStore Website

CoolStore Website is a containerised polyglot microservices application consisting of services based on .NET Core, NodeJS and more running on Service Mesh. It demonstrates how to wire up small microservices and build up a larger application using microservice architectural principals.

It's mainly building for .NET ecosystem with a lot of popular libraries and toolkits which have used by .NET community for a long time. Additionaly, it uses and experiements new components and libraries to build the modern application with cloud-native apps approach.

We have the [Vietnam Microservices Community Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/645391349250568) to write, discuss and sharing tips and tricks of how can we build and maintain microservices architectural projects.
